# OPEN QUESTIONS

* **Deployment views:** The deployment views were not included in the different modules since they are specific to the implementation details. The concrete implementation is not provided in this high level architecture. However some suggestions are made in order to preserve the main functioning of the system as a complete entity. In particular, the deployment of the Analytics Engine, Analytics Methods and Analytics Modules in the same run-time environment is vital to the architecture.
* **Security Mechanisms:** The platform does not specify the security mechanisms of the platform and are left for the implementation. This is typically handled by the frameworks used for implementation. The security mechanism should be treated twofold:
 * **User Access Control:** Users should be able to log into the system and use its capabilities through an account.
 * **API Key:** Developers and Researchers should be able to obtain an API key to use and execute the different methods provided by the complete API of the OpenLAP.
* **Concatenation of Analytics Methods:** At the point this documentation is produced, the concatenation of different Analytics Methods although theoretically possible, it is not contemplated by the workflow of the Analytics Engine. The Analytics Engine could, in later iterations, provide mechanisms to extend Triads and allow to use multiple Analytics Methods over a single execution.
