## Variability Guide
* &#60;&#60;Factory&#62;&#62;DataTransformerFactory = The &#60;&#60;Factory&#62;&#62;DataTransformerFactory is an interface which has to be implemented to provide a concrete implementation of the factory. The methods which are implemented contain the code to create instances of the `DataTransformer` from the class name. The default implementation of the factory uses the JCL library to load the `DataTransformer` classes

* &#60;&#60;Factory&#62;&#62;VisualizationCodeGeneratorFactory = The &#60;&#60;Factory&#62;&#62;VisualizationCodeGeneratorFactory is an interface which has to be implemented to provide a concrete implementation of the factory. The methods which are implemented contain the code to create instances of the `VisualizationCodeGenerator` from the class name. The default implementation of the factory uses the JCL library to load the `VisualizationCodeGenerator` classes

* VisualizationCodeGenerator = The `VisualizationCodeGenerator` is an abstract class which has methods that must be overriden by the concrete implementations. These abstract methods specify the generation of the visualization code which is sent back to client requests as well as the input and output ports in the form of the OLAPDataSet. The output ports can be safely ignored, however the input port configuration is crucial as it is used to determine if the incoming OLAPDataSet can be processed by the `VisualizationCodeGenerator`

* DataTransformer = The `DataTransformer` is an interface which has to be implemented to provide for a concrete implementation of the algorithm to transform data from the OLAPDataSet into a form parseable by the `VisualizationCodeGenerator`

## Rationale

* The OLAPDataset (Column configuration) has to be included via an overriden method in each `VisualizationCodeGenerator`. Although, this would belong in the `DataTransformer` it was explicitly included in the `VisualizationCodeGenerator` due to the reason that a single `DataTransformer` can be reused by many `VisualizationCodeGenerators`
