### Components

* **&#60;&#60;Database&#62;&#62;DataCollectionApplication**: This separate database contains the information of the registered Third Party Data Collection Applications, a relation of users that are utilizing those applications, their status, the public keys and other settings relevant to the data collection application registration. The connection to the database is ideally using JPA but other Database connection mechanisms can be used depending on the implementation and concrete database.
* **&#60;&#60;Database&#62;&#62;LCDMDatastore**: This database contains all the collected raw data of the OpenLAP system. It is the main datastore of the system and will provide for the main functionalities of the Learning Analytics exercise. It is expected to hold a representation in some SQL RDBMS or NoSQL database of the Learning Context Data Model and needs to be performant and highly available. Detains of the precise technologies and implementation of the database itself are left to the implementer. Additionally, this diagram illustrates the database as if resides on the same server as the rest of the components, however that might not be the case on the deployed application for reasons of scalability. This will be restated on the variability guide of this View.
* **&#60;&#60;Repository&#62;&#62;DataCollectionApplicaitonRepository**: This repository provides a data access layer to the properties of the Third Party Data Collection Applications, their settings.
* **&#60;&#60;Repository&#62;&#62;UserApplicationSettingsRepository**: A repository for the settings per user of the different Third Party Data Collection Applications.
* **&#60;&#60;Repository&#62;&#62;Learning Data Model Repositories**: Each repository allows data access to the main Data Store of the OpenLAP system.
* **&#60;&#60;Service&#62;&#62;DataAccessServices**: The Main service of data querying of the OpenLAP system. It provides a logical service proxy point for querying the main OpenLAP LCDM database.
* **&#60;&#60;Service&#62;&#62;DataCollectorRegistrationServices**: This is a service proxy for the creation and modification as well of private/public key pair generation for the Third Party Data Collection Applications and their settings as well as their activation per user and settings.
* **&#60;&#60;Service&#62;&#62;DataCollectionService**: This service provides a proxy for both the data collection functionalities and for managing the User settings of the Data Collection Applications that are being used by the mentioned user.
* **&#60;&#60;Controller&#62;&#62;DataCollectionController**: A REST controller for exposing via HTTP the methods for data collection, data collection user settings as well as activating and deactivating data collection applications per user.
* **&#60;&#60;Controller&#62;&#62;Learning Data Model Controllers**: Each controller will expose HTTP RESTful methods for accessing each of the different Learning Context Data Model entities.
* **&#60;&#60;Component&#62;&#62;IndicatorEngine**: The macro component of the OpenLAP system interacts with both the settings and the data of the Learning Context Data Model. Since the Indicator Engine is the main entry point for users to interact with te system, it must both provide methods to access the settings of the Third Party Data Collection Applications as well as to be able to obtain the queried data that it is intended to provide when generating Indicators.
* **&#60;&#60;Component&#62;&#62;AnalyticsEngine**: The Analytics Engine will query the data whenever Indicator requests are generated in order to pass them to the Analytics Methods and Visualizer, therefore, the Analytics engine must be able to query the central Data Store of the OpenLAP system. It will do this through prepared queries that the controller will rely to the appropriate services and repositories.
* **&#60;&#60;ExternalApplication&#62;&#62;DataCollectionApplciation**: Registered Third Party Data Collection Applications that have valid public keys and are activated are able to perform data submissions to the system through a established HTTP REST API exposed by the DataCollectionConroller.

### Connections
* Whenever the connections between components are not specified, it can be assumed that they are remote procedure calls, direct calls or Java Remote method invocation. The concrete implementation will decide the type of specific call.
* Controllers expose their methods through HTTP in a restful manner, through a facade. This allows both other internal OpenLAP components to interact with them as well as allowing any other middleware or clients to connect, given the exposure and authorization. for accessing the methods. It also decouples the functionalities of the macro component and encapsulates them for ease of installation.
* JPA would be the standard data access connection to the Databases.

## Variability Guide
* Since connections to the database and the concrete database implementation are left to the developer of this macro component, JPA can change to any sensible technology for guaranteeing the data access. The Data Access Layer is designed so new repositories can be created to interact with the concrete implementations.

## Rationale

The main idea that this view tries to convey is the RESTful approach to the macro component. Ideally, most of the macro components of the OpenLAP system will expose their functionalities through a set of HTTP endpoints that can be accessed with HTTP requests.
The Repository pattern is established so during implementation the concrete database systems can be chosen according to constrains or other requirements. The main functionalities of this macro component are exposed through two controllers: one to handle the Third Party Data Collection Application interaction for submitting data and a second controller to access the data. This separation is based on the users of those functionalities. While Third Party Applications have to perform constant but "spiked" writes in the system, they need a dedicated component to handle those submission requests. At the same time, it needs to be secure and efficient. On the other hand, the other OpenLAP macro components will perform numerous data reads and will need a mechanism for submitting custom queries generated by the Indicator Engine and the Analytics Engine.
